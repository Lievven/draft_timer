# Draft Timer
A small Dungeondraft mod to time the many hours you've sunk into your maps.

### Installation.
1. Download the mod
2. Extract the zip into your Dungeondraft mod folder.
3. If you do not have a mod folder yet, the Mods tab will let you choose one.
4. Use the mods tab to select the mod.
5. Open the map and start drafting. The clock is ticking.

### How to use.
- You can find the menu to interact with this mod in the Settings category.
- Simply click on the alarm clock icon and you can enjoy two timers to track your current session and your overall time spent.
- The timer progress saves alongside your map. So if you close without saving, you'll lose some time.
- If you increase your map size by more than 15 tiles towards the left or top, you'll be able to see the storage strings. Don't worry, simply reload the map and they'll vanish off-screen again.
- Toggle 'Pause in Background' to make the timer stop when you interact with a different window or when you minimize Dungeondraft.
- 'Minutes until AFK' on the other hand tracks how much time has passed since your last input. If you do not interact with Dungeondraft for as many minutes as you have selected, the timer will stop.
- You can disable 'Minutes until AFK' by simply lowering the value to 0.
- That means 'Minutes until AFK' and 'Pause in Background' are performing two different functions. You can activate both, to be able to stop the timer at will, but also have it automatically stop if you step away from your PC.
- If, for some reason, you need access to the save file for your user settings, you can find it in your Dungeondraft Appdata folder.

### Compatibility.
- No known imcompatiblities as of yet.
- The mod was made with parallel workflows and GIT in mind. If you merge or combine maps, simply add the text nodes from both versions to the final product and the mod should automatically combine them.
